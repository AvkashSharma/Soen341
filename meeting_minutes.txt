Meeting Friday Jan 26th 12:00 - 12:45 => 45 mins
-------------------------------------
We discussed about what MVC is and how Ruby on Rails utilize it.
We looked at 4 verbs of the HTTP protocol : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

The project time-line tentative:

1. We all do back-end ruby on rails (I include the views in html.erb format as back-end)
2. Once we are happy with all the features, we get into front-end 
3. Finally we deploy on web if we still have time

Meeting Thursday Feb 1st 15:00 - 16:05 => 1h05
--------------------------------------
We looked at where we're at in the project.

We discussed how we will use branching.
Master branch => for TA demo
Dev branch => where we merge all our features, we must git pull the last change to this branch before working on a feature
Your branch => where you will implement your feature

To start working on a feature you will go see the issues tab and assign one to yourself or create an issue that you would like our app to have.

We talked about the next core feature to implement => the Answers to the questions

the 'M' in MVC (Model-View-Controller) is about a respective table in the database. So for our Question Model, we have a table in the database named questions that has the following attributes : 'id', 'timestamp', 'title', 'text'. We can get all the questions in the database using this code in the controller => Question.all , returns an array composed of the questions

We can find a question in the table by searching for its id =>Question.find(id) or using the params thats kept in all our pages Question.find(params[:id])
