# Objective
Develop an intuitive Questions & Answers website.

# Project
The Q&A web app aims to provide a safe, welcoming and reliable environment for users who wish to ask and answer questions. Once a question has been answered, users can rate that answer in order to rank it based on user satisfaction which in return will allow users to rely on a highly-recommended answer. Users who are involved with asking and answering questions are rewarded with user rank to show their progress with the site. Also, trending questions will be a feature to see the most asked questions.
